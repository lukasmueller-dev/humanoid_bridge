# humanoid_bridge

ROS 2 bridge between a control client and Unitree (G1, H1, H1_2) or Booster (T1)
humanoids. It takes commands on `/robot_cmd`, interpolates them, runs safety
checks on command and state, and publishes motor commands at 1 kHz.

```
bridge/           the bridge and its Python client, upstream-bound
  bridge_interface/   messages and services
  robot_bridge/       C++ bridge, robot_bridge/ Python client, adapters
    examples/           reference clients per robot (not built or installed)
robot_stacks/     per-robot deploy layers
  g1/                 g1_stack, g1_camera
  t1/                 placeholder; the T1 stack has not been written
scripts/          environment setup, sourced not run
tools/            helpers, run not sourced
thirdparty/       vendored unitree_ros2 and booster_ros2_interface
```

`bridge/` depends on nothing under `robot_stacks/`. That one-way rule is what
lets either layer be split out with `git subtree split --prefix=<layer>`.

Built targets are `G1_bridge`, `H1_bridge`, `H1_2_bridge`, `T1_bridge` and
`test_node`. Other sources under `src/` are upstream leftovers that no target
builds.

## Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| OS, ROS | Ubuntu 22.04, ROS 2 Humble. Foxy + Python 3.8 on-board |
| Python | 3.10 on the workstation, 3.8 on-board |
| Not pulled by rosdep | `rosidl_generator_dds_idl`, `rmw_cyclonedds_cpp`, `numpy`, `pytest`. `tools/install-build-deps.sh` installs all four |
| G1 / H1 | [unitree_sdk2_python](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_sdk2_python) |
| T1 | [booster_robotics_sdk](https://github.com/DFKI-SAIROL/booster_robotics_sdk), built per its README. Only needed with `--t1` |

`rosidl_generator_dds_idl` is required by the vendored `unitree_*` packages and
declared in none of their `package.xml`, so nothing installs it for you.

CycloneDDS is not optional wherever GEAR is in the path: its simulator forces
raw CycloneDDS, so every ROS 2 node has to match it.

## 1. Build

Clone into a colcon workspace's `src/`, then:

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
tools/install-build-deps.sh     # first time on a fresh host
tools/build.sh                  # G1, H1, H1_2
tools/build.sh --t1             # also the Booster T1
```

The Python client installs with the package, so there is no `pip install` step
and every Python change needs a rebuild. `tools/build.sh --clean <pkg>` drops a
stale package tree.

## 2. Launch the bridge

`BRIDGE_IFACE` is the NIC CycloneDDS binds, default `enp4s0`. Set it to match
your cabling; a wrong one fails silently.

```bash
BRIDGE_IFACE=<nic> source scripts/setup_unitree.sh   # G1, H1, H1_2
source scripts/setup_booster.sh                      # T1

ros2 run robot_bridge G1_bridge --ros-args \
    --params-file bridge/robot_bridge/params/G1_config.yaml
```

Substitute `H1_bridge`, `H1_2_bridge` or `T1_bridge` and the matching config.
The bridge starts in damping mode, and refuses to start while anything else
publishes `/lowcmd`.

## 3. Launch a client

```bash
source scripts/setup_unitree.sh
EX=bridge/robot_bridge/examples/g1
pip install -r $EX/requirements.txt      # first time
python $EX/example.py
```

The examples read the robot's own joystick. They are reference code: no
CMakeLists builds or installs them.

## 4. Operate

Between start and policy inference, lower the robot until its feet touch the
ground.

Only the keys below reach the bridge. Everything commented out in the source is
listed as "service only", so use the service call instead.

| | Start control | Stop control | Ready position | Zero position |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| G1 | service only | `L2 + Up + Left` | service only | service only |
| H1 | `L2 + Start` | `L2 + Up + Left` | `L1` | `R1` |
| H1_2 | service only | `L2 + Up + Left` | service only | service only |
| T1 | `LT + RT + Start` | `Back` | `LB` | `RB` |

T1 also shuts the node down on `LT + Back`. `R2 + A` starts Unitree's own
policy, not anything here.

```bash
ros2 service call /start_control bridge_interface/srv/SetDefaultPosition \
    "{default_position: [...]}"                 # your own initial pose
ros2 service call /stop_control std_srvs/srv/Trigger {}
ros2 service call /ready_position_control std_srvs/srv/Trigger {}
ros2 service call /zero_position_control std_srvs/srv/Trigger {}
```

### G1 Dex3 hands

A separate path with its own enable, so hands can run with the body idle.
`docs/hands_path.md` has the whole picture.

```bash
ros2 service call /start_hand_control std_srvs/srv/Trigger {}
ros2 topic pub /hand_cmd/left bridge_interface/msg/HandCmd ...   # 7 motors, DDS order
ros2 service call /stop_hand_control std_srvs/srv/Trigger {}
```

## 5. Verify

No hardware. Stages that cannot run are skipped with the reason.

```bash
tools/test.sh                       # unit, then body wire, then hands
tools/test.sh --unit                # needs no ROS
tools/test.sh --stale-after 3.5     # per-side hand release
```

The unit count depends on the environment: without a sourced workspace the
tests that need `bridge_interface` skip. `tools/test.sh` prints what it ran.

## What breaks it

- **G1 and H1 need `L2 + R2` first**, to enter debug mode. Nothing responds otherwise.
- **`PYTHONPATH=.` after sourcing ROS drops rclpy.** Append instead: `.:$PYTHONPATH`.
- **Clients import the *installed* client**, so rebuild after every Python change.
- **Moving a package leaves colcon's cache pointing at the old path.**
  `tools/build.sh --clean <pkg>`.
- **`start_control` always answers `success: true`.** A `default_position` that
  is not exactly 29 long is not rejected: the bridge moves all 29 joints to
  `ready_q_` instead, legs included. Check the length yourself.
- **The first `/robot_cmd` cuts the arming ramp short.** `controlStarted_` is
  set before the 2 s ramp, so a client already streaming steps straight to its
  own target. Arm before the client streams.
- **Control stops 200 ms after the last command's interpolation ends**, unless
  `hold_position`. A chunked client must cover the gap with `duration`.
- **An abort does not release the joints.** On G1, H1 and H1_2 `finishControl_`
  only logs, so after an IMU trip or watchdog expiry the robot holds its last
  pose at full kp/kd. Only T1 drops to damping.
- **`kp = 0` makes the torque clamp a no-op for that joint** (`upper_limbs_kp_min: 0.0`).
- **`robot_bridge/package.xml` depends on `booster_interface` unconditionally**,
  so it builds even with T1 off.
- **Hand control needs its own `/start_hand_control`.** `/start_control` does
  not enable it, and it refuses any hand whose state topic is silent.
- **`create domain error` from a DDS client**: `unitree_sdk2py` hardcodes
  `/tmp/cdds.LOG`, owned by whoever ran first. `CYCLONEDDS_URI` cannot override
  it; the inline config wins.

Limits, gains and joint tables live in `bridge/robot_bridge/params/`.
