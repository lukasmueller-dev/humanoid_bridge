# 🤖 Humanoid_bridge Overview

`Humanoid_bridge` is a ROS 2 package for controlling Unitree and Booster robots (e.g., H1, G1, T1).
It receives commands from the client node, decides whether to perform command interpolation, and, after completing command and state safety checks, sends real-time motor control commands to the robot.

---

## Installation

Prepare the library for T1 robot:
```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/DFKI-SAIROL/booster_robotics_sdk.git
cd booster_robotics_sdk
./install.sh
```
Afer that you can follow the `README` of booster_robotics_sdk to build and prepare the python environment for T1.




Prepare the library for G1 and H1 robot:
```bash
conda create -n {YOUR_ENV} python=3.10 # this is for ros2 humble, if on board using foxy, please use 3.8
conda activate {YOUR_ENV}

conda install pytorch==2.3.1 torchvision==0.18.1 torchaudio==2.3.1 pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia # if you connect the robot with cable and deploy it on your PC with ros hummble.
pip3 install --no-cache https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/redist/jp/v511/pytorch/torch-2.0.0a0+fe05266f.nv23.04-cp38-cp38-linux_aarch64.whl #if you deploy it on board with ros2 foxy.

cd ~
git clone https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_sdk2_python.git
cd unitree_sdk2_python
export CYCLONEDDS_HOME=$HOME/cyclonedds/install # Just for on board
pip3 install -e .
```







Then create your own workspace in your home and enter its `src` folder, for example:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/sairol_ws/src
cd ~/sairol_ws/src
```
Clone this code repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:DFKI-SAIROL/humanoid_bridge.git
```
Build the package:
```bash
cd ..
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
colcon build #if T1
colcon build --cmake-args -DBUILD_BOOSTER_T1=OFF # if H1 or G1 
```


## Operation guide 
### Launch bridge interface
Open a terminal for bridge interface, for T1:
```bash
    cd ~/sairol_ws
    source src/humanoid_bridge/setup_booster.sh 
```
For unitree G1 or H1. Modify the net port like enp$s0 here according to your net configuration before source it if you connect the robot with cable:
```bash
    cd ~/sairol_ws
    source src/humanoid_bridge/setup_unitree.sh 
```
then launch the bridge interface:
```bash
    ros2 run robot_bridge T1_bridge --ros-args --params-file src/humanoid_bridge/robot_bridge/params/T1_config.yaml  #if booster T1
    ros2 run robot_bridge G1_bridge --ros-args --params-file src/humanoid_bridge/robot_bridge/params/G1_config.yaml #if unitree G1
    ros2 run robot_bridge H1_bridge --ros-args --params-file src/humanoid_bridge/robot_bridge/params/H1_config.yaml #if unitree H1
```
For G1 and H1, you need also to press `L2 + R2`, to change to the debug mode firstly.

### Launch client node
#### Environment prepare:
Now the bridge interface is already launched, and initial mode is damping mode.
Next you can launch your client node. Here we have provided an example for your reference. But here you need install some packages firstly in you environment for the first time:
```bash 
    cd ~/sairol_ws
    conda activate {YOUR_ENV} # activate your environment relevant to T1 or G1, H1 
    cd src/humanoid_bridge/robot_bridge
    pip install -e .
```
If T1, you need more installation:
```bash
    cd example/T1
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If G1, you need more installation:
```bash
    cd example/G1
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If H1, you need more installation:
```bash
    cd example/H1
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### Client node:
Then open a new terminal for client node:
```bash
    cd ~/sairol_ws

    source src/humanoid_bridge/setup_booster.sh #if booster T1
    source src/humanoid_bridge/setup_unitree.sh #if unitree G1 or H1
    
    python src/humanoid_bridge/robot_bridge/example/T1/T1_example.py #if booster T1
    python src/humanoid_bridge/robot_bridge/example/G1/G1_example.py #if booster G1
    python src/humanoid_bridge/robot_bridge/example/H1/H1_example.py #if booster H1
```

With this example you can use remote controller to select the mode and:

#### T1 operation instruction:
 use `D-pad (up, down, left, right)` to control the robot movement and press down either `joystick` to stop the movement. Tilt the right joystick to left/right to control the robot yaw rotation. You can see the current velocity in terminal output. 
In case of emergency, use `LT + Back` to switch the mode forcefully to damping mode. 

Step1: Press `LT + start` to send the `start service` request for starting the control, then bridge can start to publish lowcmd     
        if there is lowcmd from client and checkout custom mode, then move to defauft position for standing.

Step2: Lower the robot’s body and make its feet touch the ground.

Step3: Press `LT + A` to start the policy inference, then robot can use policy to keep standing.

Step4: Use keyboad (w,s,a,d,space) to control the robot

Step5: Press `back` to send the `stop service` request for stopping the control, then bridge can stop to publish any lowcmd and 
        checkout damping mode .

#### G1 operation instruction:   
use two joysticks to control the robot movement. Tilt the left joystick to control the robot translation. Tilt the right joystick to left/right to control the robot yaw rotation. You can see the current velocity in terminal output.  

Step1: Press `L2 + start` to send the `start service` request for starting the control, then bridge can start to publish lowcmd     
        if there is lowcmd from client and checkout custom mode, then move to defauft position for standing.

Step2: Lower the robot’s body and make its feet touch the ground.

Step3: Press `R2 + A` to start the policy inference, then robot can use policy to keep standing.

Step4: Use keyboad (w,s,a,d,space) to control the robot

Step5: Press `L2 + up + left` to send the `stop service` request for stopping the control, then bridge can stop to publish any lowcmd and 
        checkout damping mode .

#### H1 operation instruction:   
use two joysticks to control the robot movement. Tilt the left joystick to control the robot translation. Tilt the right joystick to left/right to control the robot yaw rotation. You can see the current velocity in terminal output.  

Step1: Press `L2 + start` to send the `start service` request for starting the control, then bridge can start to publish lowcmd     
        if there is lowcmd from client and checkout custom mode, then move to defauft position for standing.

Step2: Lower the robot’s body and make its feet touch the ground.

Step3: Press `R2 + A` to start the policy inference, then robot can use policy to keep standing.

Step4: Use keyboad (w,s,a,d,space) to control the robot

Step5: Press `L2 + up + left` to send the `stop service` request for stopping the control, then bridge can stop to publish any lowcmd and 
        checkout damping mode .

### Notes
For step 1 you can also use your own joints position for initial joints position with ros2 service command instead of remote controller:
```bash
    ros2 service call /start_control bridge_interface/srv/SetDefaultPosition "{
        default_position: [0, 0,
                            0.2, -1.35, 0, -0.5,
                            0.2, 1.35, 0, 0.5,
                            0,
                            -0.2, 0, 0, 0.4, -0.25, 0,
                            -0.2, 0, 0, 0.4, -0.25, 0]
        }"
```
And for step 5 you can also use ros2 service command instead of remote controller:
```bash
    ros2 service call /stop_control std_srvs/srv/Trigger {}
```

## Other demos
In addition, we have prepared some other demos after you launch `T1_example.py`, `G1_example.py` or `H1_example.py` such as ready position control: 
```bash
    ros2 service call /ready_position_control std_srvs/srv/Trigger {} # you can also press LB/L1 of controller
```
And zero position control:
```bash
    ros2 service call /zero_position_control std_srvs/srv/Trigger {}  # you can also press RB/R1 of controller  
```
But you should pay attention to stopping policy inference firstly.
If you want to modify the default configuration of the bridge interface like kp/kd limit or tau limit, you can jump into the /robot_bridge/params to modify.
