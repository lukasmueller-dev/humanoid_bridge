#
# Two things this exists to get right:
#   - BUILD_BOOSTER_T1 defaults ON in CMake upstream and wants a Booster SDK at
#     $HOME/library/booster/include. Only a T1 host has one, so the default here
#     is OFF and --t1 opts in after checking the SDK is present.
#   - colcon never removes what it installed, so a renamed or deleted node keeps
#     being offered by `ros2 run` until its build/ and install/ trees go.
#     --clean <pkg> is that.
#
# Safe to re-run.

Usage: tools/build.sh [options] [-- colcon args...]

colcon build this workspace. Booster T1 is off unless you ask for it.

Options:
  --workspace <path>  colcon workspace root (default: the dir above src/)
  --t1                also build T1_bridge; needs the Booster SDK headers
  --clean <pkg>       drop build/<pkg> and install/<pkg> first; repeatable
  --clean-all         drop build/, install/ and log/ first
  -h, --help          this text

Environment:
  BOOSTER_INCLUDE     Booster SDK include dir (default ~/library/booster/include)

Anything after -- goes to colcon, e.g.
  tools/build.sh -- --packages-select robot_bridge

Then: tools/test.sh
