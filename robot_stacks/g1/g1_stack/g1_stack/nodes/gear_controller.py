"""The GEAR WBC control loop, launched through the DFKI bridge.

Same flags as upstream's `run_g1_control_loop`; the only change is the command
sender: GEAR -> robot_bridge.adapters.gear_wbc -> /robot_cmd -> G1_bridge
-> /lowcmd. GEAR opens no rt/lowcmd publisher, so the bridge can start.

Arming is the operator's step, not this process's: the bridge drops every
/robot_cmd until `start_control` is called (benches/g1/bench.md, "Bring up the
bridge").

Runs in SIMPLE's venv with the ROS workspace sourced:

    source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash && source ~/bridge_ws/install/setup.bash
    PYTHONPATH=.:$PYTHONPATH \\
        ~/github/SIMPLE/.venv/bin/python -m g1_stack.nodes.gear_controller \\
        --interface real --enable-waist --messaging-backend zmq --zmq-host 127.0.0.1

    """Start ROS inside GEAR's channel init, then hand `config` to upstream.

    The order is the whole point. GEAR's raw CycloneDDS has to create the DDS
    domain before rclpy does. `ChannelFactory.Init` calls `Domain(id, config)`
    (`unitree_sdk2py/core/channel.py`), which cannot create a domain that
    rmw_cyclonedds already made: it prints "[ChannelFactory] create domain
    error", returns False, and nothing ever publishes `rt/lowstate`, so the
    bridge waits for a publisher forever.

    GEAR calls `init_channel` immediately before building `G1Body`, and `G1Body`
    resolves `BodyCommandSender` at construction, so this one hook is both late
    enough for the channel and early enough for the sender. `G1ThreeFingerHand`
    resolves `HandCommandSender` at construction too, a few lines later in the
    same `G1Env.__init__`, so the hands install in the same window.

    Both senders are swapped unconditionally, whatever `with_hands` says. It
    defaults True and no config here turns it off, so leaving the hand sender
    alone means GEAR opens `rt/dex3/<side>/cmd` itself and hand commands reach
    the motors without ever passing the bridge -- the one thing this whole path
    exists to prevent.

    `init_channel` is wrapped on `g1_env`, not on `simulator_factory`: `g1_env`
    imported the name, so rebinding the source module rebinds a copy nobody
    reads. That wrap fixes the order.

    `ChannelFactory.Init` is wrapped to become idempotent, which fixes the
    count. GEAR initialises the channel more than once -- `g1_env`, then
    `base_sim` again when the simulator starts -- and `ChannelFactory` is a
    singleton whose `Init` is not guarded, so the second call re-runs
    `Domain(id, config)` on a domain that now exists and returns False. The
    class is patched rather than `ChannelFactoryInitialize`, because every
    caller imported that function by name but they all reach this one class.

    `ChannelConfigHasInterface` is forced to `multicast="true"`, which fixes
    discovery. The template is handed straight to `Domain(id, config)`, so
    `CYCLONEDDS_URI` cannot reach it, and `"default"` on `lo` resolves to off
    ("selected interface lo is not multicast-capable"): the sim and the bridge
    then never find each other. Forcing it here rather than setting the
    interface's MULTICAST flag keeps a rehearsal from needing root on every new
    machine. It is patched on `channel`, which imported the name, not on
    `channel_config`. On a real NIC `"true"` and `"default"` agree.

    Any of the three names moving upstream raises here, rather than silently
    leaving the failure it exists to avoid.
