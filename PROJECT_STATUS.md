## Goal

The lab's robot stack for Unitree (G1, H1, H1_2) and Booster (T1) humanoids, in
two layers, so the bridge layer can go back to DFKI as PRs while the per-robot
deploy layers stay independent of it.

## Architecture

```
bridge/           upstream-bound: bridge_interface (msgs, srvs), robot_bridge (C++ + Python client)
robot_stacks/     per-robot deploy layers; g1/ holds g1_stack and g1_camera
scripts/          environment setup, sourced not run
thirdparty/       vendored unitree_ros2, booster_ros2_interface
```

Fork of `DFKI-SAIROL/humanoid_bridge`. `bridge/` imports nothing from
`robot_stacks/`; that one-way rule keeps either layer a `git subtree split`.

Deploy layers split by *owner*, not file type: code bound for a different
machine or a different Python floor is its own package.

## Key decisions

_One line each, dated, with a pointer (commit or PR)._

- 2026-09-09: Two layers, `bridge/` and `robot_stacks/<robot>/`, one-way dependency — commit `chore: restructure into bridge/ and robot_stacks/ layers`
- 2026-09-09: `robot_bridge_py` → `robot_bridge`; divergence from upstream paths accepted over deferring the rename — same commit
- 2026-09-09: Packaging metadata stays in `setup.py`; `pyproject.toml` is tool config only, because system setuptools is 59.6 and PEP 621 needs ≥61 — same commit
- 2026-09-09: Jetson-bound code stays its own package `g1_camera`, a sibling of `g1_stack` under `robot_stacks/g1/`: the package boundary makes the isolation structural rather than a convention a test has to defend, and it is shallower than folding it in — commit `refactor(g1_stack)`
- 2026-09-10: Dex3 hands get their own bridge path — two per-side topics, own enable, own 100 Hz timer — rather than joining the 29-joint body vector, because the hands are a separate device with their own state topic and rate; `docs/hands_path.md`
- 2026-09-10: a hand release is limp (`kp = kd = 0`), deliberately unlike the body's hold-last-pose, because a hand here holds nothing critical and limp cannot cook a stalled finger — same doc
- 2026-09-10: `adapters/gear_hands.py` is a pass-through, not a remap: GEAR's `HandCommandSender` already takes DDS order, and the goal-order remap belongs in `g1_stack.gear.goal.hand_from_pose` where the goal order is defined — same doc
- 2026-09-10: `BridgeCore::checkMotorCmd_` uses `std::abs`, not the original's unqualified `abs`, which resolved to the integer overload and truncated any |value| < 1 to 0. The body path's "unreasonably large" guard was much weaker than it read; this is a behaviour change on the body path — commit `27f93c9`
- 2026-09-10: build and test are scripts, not doc paragraphs: `tools/` holds executables, `scripts/` stays sourced-only. Build deps that rosdep cannot pull now live here rather than only in the consumer repo's Dockerfile — `docs/handover-audit.md`
- 2026-09-10: `fake_dex3.py`'s `--stale-after`/`--hot-after` clocks start at the first `/dex3/left/cmd`, not process start, so the documented 3.0-4.0 window means what the prose always claimed — same doc
- 2026-09-09: `examples/` sits inside `robot_bridge`, the package it demonstrates, so a subtree split of `bridge/` carries it; excluded from lint as vendored upstream code — same commit

## Roadmap

Planned work lives in `PROJECT_ROADMAP.md`; this file keeps only the pointer.

## Open questions

- Does `robot_stacks/g1/` stay in this repo or become its own? DFKI's call, deferred.
- What should `finishControl_` release to on Unitree? `T1_bridge.cpp:304` already drops to damping; G1, H1 and H1_2 only log. Whether the Unitree answer is the same needs the lab.
- Dex3 left/right read order: which half of the 14-vector is which hand, and which motor index is which finger. Hands are not mounted; verifiable against the fake only. `dex3_probe` read mode answers it.
