## Items

### Handover

- [ ] Finish the handover pass in `docs/handover-audit.md`: bring-up scripts,
  the `bridge/` conftest, moving bridge-behaviour facts out of the consumer
  repo, and the dead-code cleanup.
  **Done when:** every P1 and P2 item in that plan is done and the audit is
  deleted.

### Hand path

Built, compiled and verified against the fakes (`tools/test.sh`, all stages
pass on both CycloneDDS and Fast DDS). Design in `docs/hands_path.md`. What is
left needs hardware:

- [ ] Confirm the Dex3 read order against hardware once the hands are mounted:
  bend one left-hand finger and watch which side and which motor index answers.
  `dex3_probe --iface <if>` read mode is what answers it.
  **Done when:** `g1_stack/robot.py`'s UNCONFIRMED note on hand order is gone
  or corrected, and `hand_from_pose` is checked against a real hand.
- [ ] Decide whether the bridge should republish hand state as a
  `bridge_interface` message, so `g1_stack` can drop its raw-DDS hand reader.
  Blocked on whether the Jetson ever needs hand state.
  **Done when:** either the message exists and `g1_stack` uses it, or the
  duplication is documented as deliberate.

### Motor probe

Built on `feat-motor-probe` (branched off `feat-hands-path`, which must land
first). Backend, page and tests are done; no ROS path has ever executed.

- [ ] Run `motor_probe` end to end on a machine with ROS 2: `colcon build`, start
  `G1_bridge` against `fake_g1.py`, then `motor_probe --port 8080` and jog one
  joint from the page. `fake_g1` tracks commands perfectly, so the on-screen
  model should follow the slider exactly.
  **Done when:** a slider drag moves the right joint in the 3D view, the deadman
  releases the robot when the tab closes, and `run_fake_wire_test.sh` still passes.
- [ ] Confirm the Dex3 read order with the panel once the hands are mounted —
  jog `L_HAND_THUMB_0` and watch which motor answers. This is what
  `g1_stack/robot.py`'s UNCONFIRMED note asks for, and the panel is the tool for it.
  **Done when:** the note is gone or corrected.
- [ ] Decide whether the ~2.2 MB of vendored `three.js` / `urdf-loader` under
  `motor_probe/static/vendor/` belongs in git. There is no CDN at runtime on the
  lab network, so the options are vendoring or a fetch step like the assets have.
  **Done when:** either the vendor tree is deliberately committed and noted in the
  README, or it is gitignored and a fetch script populates it.

### Upstream fixes — one branch each

- [ ] `fix/start-control-validate`: `startControlServiceCB_` answers `success: true` with an "invalid size" message unconditionally, then `initControl_` moves to `ready_q_` on a wrong length. **Done when:** a wrong length is rejected, the answer is false, and nothing moves.
- [ ] `fix/g1-default-pos-29`: G1 `_default_pos` is 27 long while kp/kd are 29 (`robot_client.py`). **Done when:** all three are 29 and a length check fails loudly.
- [ ] `fix/config-keymaps`: the stale keymap headers are corrected here (G1 and H1_2 advertised four keys the source comments out; T1 omitted `RT` from the start combo; H1 was right). Still to send upstream. **Done when:** the PR is open.
- [ ] `feat/g1-finish-control-release`: `finishControl_` only logs, so an abort holds the last pose at full kp/kd. **Done when:** an abort releases as the lab defines it — see the open question in `PROJECT_STATUS.md`.

### Cleanups

- [ ] Decide whether the service-call futures in `robot_client.py` should be awaited. Two are assigned and dropped (`init_control`, `stop_control`), currently ruff-suppressed as `F841`. **Done when:** the calls either await or explicitly document fire-and-forget, and the suppression is gone.
- [ ] Split `robot_client.py` (~600 lines): per-robot `default_pos`/kp/kd tables and `KeyMap` out of the client body. **Done when:** the tables are data in their own module and the ruff `E501` suppression for its commented-out keymap blocks is gone.
- [ ] `--interface sim` does not reach the bridge: MuJoCo listens on `rt/lowcmd`, which the bridge owns. **Done when:** a sim run drives the same client path as hardware, or the limitation is documented as permanent.
